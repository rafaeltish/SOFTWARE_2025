## 💻 How it Works

1. The program defines a dictionary called `users` containing IDs as keys and names as values.
2. It prompts the user to **enter their ID** using the `input()` function.
3. It checks whether the entered ID exists in the dictionary.
4. If found, it displays the user’s name. Otherwise, it prints **"ID not found."**
